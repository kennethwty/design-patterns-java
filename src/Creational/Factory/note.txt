    Creational Design Pattern - Factory

    Author: Tsz Yan "Kenneth" Wong

    Concepts:
        - Doesn't expose instantiation logic
        - Defer to subclass
        - Common interface
        - Parameter driven
        - Solves complex creation
        - Specified by architecture, implemented by users
        - Sometimes viewed as an opposite of the Singleton design pattern
        - Examples:
            - Calendar
            - ResourceBundle
            - NumberFormat
