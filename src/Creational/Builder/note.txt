    Creational Design Pattern - Builder

    Author: Tsz Yan "Kenneth" Wong

    Concepts:
        - Great for handling the construction of objects that may contain a lot of parameters
        - Want to make the objects immutable once they are constructed

        * Large number of parameters
        * Complex constructors
        * Immutability

        - Examples:
            - StringBuilder
            - DocumentBuilder
            - Locale.Builder
