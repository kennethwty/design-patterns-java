    Structural Design Pattern - Bridge

    Author: Tsz Yan "Kenneth" Wong

    Concepts:
        - Decouple abstraction and implementation
        - Encapsulation, Composition, Inheritance
        - Changes in Abstraction won't affect the client
        - Details won't be right

        Note: Similar to the Adapter design pattern, but it works with new code instead of legacy code

    Design:
        - Utilize Interfaces and Abstract classes
        - Composition over Inheritance
        - More than just Composition
        - Designed to expect changes from both sides
        - Abstraction, Implementor, Refined Abstraction, Concrete Implementor

    Example:

    Pitfalls:
